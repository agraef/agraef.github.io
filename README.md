# Welcome!

You've reached Albert Gr√§f's presence on Github. I'm a [computer scientist and mathematician](aboutme.md) working at the [Johannes Gutenberg University][0] (JGU) at Mainz, Germany. Here you can find pointers to the source code and documentation of my functional programming language [Pure][1] (now on Github) and related projects still mostly hosted on Bitbucket. In particular, there's also some software for [Faust][5], Grame's functional dsp programming language, [Pd][7], Miller Puckette's graphical computer music and multimedia environment, and Dave Robillard's [LV2][11], the new audio and MIDI plugin standard for Linux and other Unix systems.

Please note that this site is in a perpetual state of construction, and also serves as a grab bag for various other side projects. I will hopefully turn it into a full website some time, but for the time being, here's a brief overview of the available projects.

## The Pure programming language

* The [pure-lang][2] source code repository has the source code of the Pure programming language interpreter and various addon modules. In particular, there are the [pd-pure](https://agraef.github.io/pure-docs/pd-pure.html) and [pd-faust](https://agraef.github.io/pure-docs/pd-faust.html) modules which let you run Pure and Faust programs as Pd externals.

* The Pure Language and Library Documentation is available in [html][3a] and [pdf][3b] format. There's also a [Pure Quick Reference][4] guide for the impatient.

* [sublime-pure](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/sublime-pure) provides Pure language support for the [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) editor.

* The [pygments-lexer-pure](https://github.com/agraef/pygments-lexer-pure) addon lets you highlight Pure syntax using [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).

## The computer music and multimedia corner

* [apcmini-ardour](https://github.com/agraef/apcmini-ardour): These are my Ardour bindings for the [AKAI APCmini](http://www.akaipro.com/products/pad-controllers/apc-mini) controller which turn the APCmini into a useful DAW controller. There's a little [pdf](https://github.com/agraef/apcmini-ardour/blob/master/APCmini-Ardour.pdf) manual available. (This is now largely obsolete with the advent of the midizap program which also includes a Mackie emulation for the APCmini, see below.)

* [EZ-AG](https://github.com/agraef/ez-ag) is a Pd patch which aims to make it easier to use Yamaha's "learning guitar", the [Yamaha EZ-AG](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/353860-REG/Yamaha_EZAG_EZ_AG_Self_Teaching_Guitar.html), as a MIDI controller. Also works with the [Jamstik](https://jamstik.com/). Best used with [Purr Data][21].

* [faust-lv2](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/faust-lv2) is my latest and greatest version of the LV2 plugin architecture for the Faust programming language. This gives you a convenient way to create LV2 effect and instrument plugins from Faust programs.

* [faust-vst](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/faust-vst) is a port of faust-lv2 to Steinberg's [VST][19] plugin standard. I recommend using LV2 if possible, since it's an open standard. However, none of the commercial DAWs seem to implement LV2 (yet), so this architecture gives you a way to run your Faust plugins with those programs. Note that to compile the generated plugins, you'll also need Steinberg's VST SDK which isn't redistributable, so you need to download it yourself; please check the included README file for details.

* [midizap](https://github.com/agraef/midizap) translates Jack MIDI input to X11 keyboard and mouse events as well as MIDI output, so that you can use it to operate your favorite multimedia applications such as audio and video editors and DAW software. It is a much enhanced version of my own fork of Eric Messick's ShuttlePRO program (see below) which provides similar functionality for the Contour Design Shuttle devices. An Arch PKGBUILD is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/midizap-git/).

* [myblocks](https://github.com/agraef/myblocks) is a simple C+Lua interface and Pd external for the [BLOCKS SDK](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/BLOCKS-SDK). This module lets you manage and control the [Roli BLOCKS](https://roli.com/products/blocks/) devices in Linux. The Pd external is written in Lua and thus requires Pd-Lua (see below). The build system currently targets Linux and requires gcc and GNU make, but the code should work on any platform supported by [JUCE](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE) and thus porting to Mac or Windows should be a piece of cake.

* [osc2midi-utils](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/osc2midi-utils) is a collection of utilities to deal with [TouchOSC][12] layouts and [osc2midi][20] map files. Currently it offers a converter from TouchOSC layouts to osc2midi map files and a graphical frontend to the osc2midi program, Spencer Jackson's configurable OSC-(Jack)MIDI bridge written in C.  Requires Pure, as well as Tcl/Tk and Gnocl.

* The [Pd-L2Ork Arch Package Repository](https://l2orkaur.bitbucket.io/) has binary packages for pd-l2ork, purr-data (Jonathan Wilkes' new cross-platform variant of pd-l2ork), as well as builds of pd-pure and pd-faust for pd-l2ork/purr-data and all required dependencies not readily available in the standard Arch repositories. There's also an extensive README there with setup instructions, list of related AUR packages, etc. Essentially the same set of packages is also available for Ubuntu, please check the [Pd-L2Ork Ubuntu PPAs](https://l2orkubuntu.bitbucket.io/) page for details.

* [pd-jacktime](https://github.com/agraef/pd-jacktime) is a Pd external written in Lua which provides a basic interface to the Jack transport client API. This lets you sync your Pd patches to Jack time masters such as [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) and [Hydrogen](http://hydrogen-music.org). Requires [pd-lua](https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua) (and [Jack](http://jackaudio.org/), of course). An Arch PKGBUILD is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pd-jacktime-git/).

* [pd-lua](https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua) is a fork of umlaeute's [repository](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-multimedia/pd-lua.git) with minor touches to provide support for Lua 5.3. Use this to enjoy Claude Heiland-Allen's very nice Pd-Lua module which lets you program Pd externals in the [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) scripting language. An Arch PKGBUILD is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pd-lua-git/). Included in [Purr Data][21] as of version 2.5.

* [pd-lv2plugin](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/pd-lv2plugin) is an LV2 plugin host for Pd, written in Pure. It provides a Pd external `lv2plugin~` which lets you run LV2 audio and MIDI plugins in Pd.

* [pd-mdnsbrowser](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/pd-mdnsbrowser) is a [Zeroconf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking) external for Pd written in Pure, which lets you discover and publish services in the local network, so that your Pd patches can establish network connections in an automatic fashion. This is a standalone version of the `oscbrowser` object in pd-touchosc (see below), but it isn't limited to OSC services, so it can be used for any kind of TCP- or UDP-based service running in the local Zeroconf domain.

* [pd-smmf](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/pd-smmf): Documentation and examples for the Pd "Simple MIDI Message Format", a symbolic MIDI representation in Pd message format. This is used by most of my Pd externals using MIDI in some way, but is useful in its own right if you need to pass around MIDI data in Pd. Two abstractions midi-input.pd and midi-output.pd are included to translate between Pd's built-in MIDI I/O and SMMF. (These abstractions are just plain Pd patches which require no additional software to work, but the other examples included in the package require either pd-lua or pd-pure.)

* [pd-touchosc](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/pd-touchosc) is a TouchOSC MIDI bridge written in Pure. This is a collection of Pd externals and patches which make it easy to interface Pd to [TouchOSC][12], an OSC and MIDI control surface for Android and iOS devices. Please note that this has mostly been superseded by Spencer Jackson's osc2midi and my osc2midi-utils package (see above).

* [pizmidi](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/pizmidi/) is a comprehensive suite of VST MIDI plugins for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. This is a fork of the original source code by Reuben Vinal at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pizmidi/) with some minor touches for Linux compatibility. An Arch PKGBUILD is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pizmidi-git/).

* The [Pure LAC09 examples](https://github.com/agraef/pure-lac09) are back! You can also download them as a [tarball](https://github.com/agraef/pure-lac09/archive/1.0.tar.gz) or a [zip archive](https://github.com/agraef/pure-lac09/archive/1.0.zip) again. These are the accompanying materials for my presentation "Signal Processing in the Pure Programming Language" at the Linux Audio Conference 2009 at Parma, with some minor touches for compatibility with present-day Pure. They were originally on Pure's GoogleCode page, but got lost when GC closed its doors. Since the paper and the accompanying materials are still valid and may still be useful for Pure users, they have found a new home on Github now.

* The Purr Data [Github mirror][21] provides a one-stop shop for Jonathan Wilkes' new cross-platform variant of Pd-l2ork (a Pd version with a much improved GUI and lots of bundled externals).

* **New** [Raptor](https://github.com/agraef/raptor-lua): An aleatoric arpeggiator and real-time algorithmic composition program based on the mathematical music theories of the contemporary composer and pioneer of computer music [Clarence Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Barlow). Now at version 6, which is the most recent Lua-based version. (The program is implemented as a Pd patch, but the algorithmic composition core is written in Lua, so you'll need [pd-lua](https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua) to run the patch.)

* [rigkontrol](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/rigkontrol) is a Pd patch which translates control signals from Native Instrument's [Guitar Rig Kontrol](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep04/articles/niguitar.htm#2) foot switch to MIDI CC. You'll find this patch useful if you have a Rig Kontrol device lying around which you want to put to good use by hooking it up to your DAW or other MIDI-capable hard- and software. No special externals or addons are required, so the patch should work with any Pd flavor out there. Only the Rig Kontrol 1 (the original blue one) is supported right now, but adjusting the patch to later GR Kontrol versions should be a piece of cake. :)

* [sclsyx](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/sclsyx) is a little Pure script which helps you create MIDI Tuning Standard (MTS) sysex or MIDI files from musical tunings in Manuel Op de Coul's [Scala](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/) format. It can also print the sysex messages in a human-readable format on the terminal, from where you can copy and paste the data into DAWs which support manual entry of sysex messages. This program is also available as a Pd external in the [pd-smmf](https://bitbucket.org/agraef/pd-smmf) package, see above.

* [ShuttlePRO](https://github.com/agraef/ShuttlePRO) is a user program for interpreting input from a [Contour Design Shuttle](https://www.contourdesign.com/product/shuttlepro-v2/) device. This is a fork of [nanosyzygy's original version](https://github.com/nanosyzygy/ShuttlePRO) which adds many enhancements such as Jack MIDI support, so that the device can also be used as a MIDI controller. An Arch PKGBUILD is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shuttlepro-git/).

* [xwiimote-lua](https://github.com/agraef/xwiimote-lua) is a Pd external written in Lua which provides easy access to the Wii Remote on Linux, using the [xwiimote](http://dvdhrm.github.io/xwiimote/) library. (The package also includes a little Lua wrapper of libxwiimote which may be useful to Lua programmers who don't run Pd but are looking for a way to access the Wii Remote from Lua.)

## Notes

The Faust-related software has been tested and is known to work with recent Faust versions available in the [Faust git repository](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust). The Pd externals have been tested and work with both [vanilla Pd][8] and with the [pd-extended][9], [pd-l2ork][10] and [purr-data][21] distributions. (A few of the newer patches may require the latest and greatest purr-data to work properly, but this is mentioned on the corresponding project pages.)

Source tarballs and binary packages for Pure and related projects can be found on the [Download](https://github.com/agraef/pure-lang/wiki/Download) page of the Pure project.
